    Maybe I can write a little guide for absolute beginners who just want their games to work with the Steam snap. :thinking:

    After installing Steam Snap because of the isolated nature of snap, make sure in the terminal to manually connect at least:
    snap connect steam:network-control
    snap connect steam:system-observe
    snap connect steam:dot-local-share-steam
    snap connect steam:hardware-observe
    snap connect steam:process-control
